âœ¦ Yes, exactly. You need to configure these policies directly from the Supabase 
  portal (dashboard).

  setup.sql manages your database schema, but Supabase Storage RLS policies are 
  managed separately within the Supabase Storage service.

  Here are the step-by-step instructions for configuring Storage RLS policies in 
  the Supabase dashboard for the website_images bucket. These are manual steps 
  that need to be performed in your Supabase project's web interface:

   1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard: Open your web browser and navigate to your 
      Supabase project dashboard.
   2. Navigate to the "Storage" section: In the left sidebar, find and click on 
      "Storage".
   3. Select the `website_images` bucket: You should see a list of your storage 
      buckets. Click on the website_images bucket.
   4. Go to "Policies": Within the website_images bucket settings, click on the 
      "Policies" tab.
   5. Review existing policies: Look for any existing policies.
       * If no policies exist or they are too restrictive: You'll need to create or 
         modify them.
   6. Create or modify policies to allow authenticated users to upload and update 
      files:
       * Policy for INSERT (Upload):
           * Click "New Policy".
           * Choose "Create a policy from scratch".
           * Name: e.g., "Allow authenticated uploads".
           * Operations: Select INSERT.
           * Target Roles: Select authenticated.
           * USING expression: (bucket_id = 'website_images')
           * WITH CHECK expression: (bucket_id = 'website_images')
           * Save the policy.
       * Policy for UPDATE:
           * Click "New Policy".
           * Choose "Create a policy from scratch".
           * Name: e.g., "Allow authenticated updates".
           * Operations: Select UPDATE.
           * Target Roles: Select authenticated.
           * USING expression: (bucket_id = 'website_images')
           * WITH CHECK expression: (bucket_id = 'website_images')
           * Save the policy.
       * Policy for SELECT (Read): (Often needed for displaying images)
           * Click "New Policy".
           * Choose "Create a policy from scratch".
           * Name: e.g., "Allow authenticated reads".
           * Operations: Select SELECT.
           * Target Roles: Select authenticated.
           * USING expression: (bucket_id = 'website_images')
           * Save the policy.
       * Policy for DELETE: (If you want authenticated users to be able to delete 
         images)
           * Click "New Policy".
           * Choose "Create a policy from scratch".
           * Name: e.g., "Allow authenticated deletes".
           * Operations: Select DELETE.
           * Target Roles: Select authenticated.
           * USING expression: (bucket_id = 'website_images')
